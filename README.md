## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for form validation

### What I Learned

Working on this project helped me to refine several key concepts. Here's a snippet of code that Iâ€™m particularly proud of:

```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (input.value.trim() !== '' && input.value.match(emailPattern)) {
        errorMessage.textContent = ' ';
        input.classList.remove('icon')
    } else {
        errorMessage.textContent = 'Please provide a valid email';
        input.classList.add('icon')
    }
});
```

This JavaScript code handles the form validation, ensuring that users cannot submit the form without a valid email address. I also enjoyed working on the responsive design using Flexbox to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on enhancing my proficiency with JavaScript, particularly in form validation and error handling. I also aim to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
